## How to run
* Verify that you have pip installed by running `pip -V`
* In the project root foler, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Now you can simply run `python main.py` in the root folder and use the graphical interface to interact with the program. Note that a lot of complementary information will only show on the terminal.
